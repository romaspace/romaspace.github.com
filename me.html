  I am a software engineer by education and a chef by passion. 
  After working for 6 years in the IT industry I turned a home maker. 
  With two kids, I spend most of my time creating new dishes for them.....tricking nutrition into their food, in disguise sometimes.

  I have authored a baby food cook book called <a href="/new">60 great baby food recipes</a>. It is a collection of dishes perfect 
  for babies in the age group of 6-24 months. After my struggle and confusion in introducing solids to my babies I put this book 
  together for other moms like me. The recipes have been written with the help of pediatricians and nutritionists to ensure perfection.

  Besides cooking, I enjoy photography and <a href="http://romasharma.com">blogging</a>. I love to take holidays every once in a way and 
  run away to some place where I can learn a local cuisine. I also like watching plays, doing craft work with my kids and chatting 
  with friends over a cup of tea.
