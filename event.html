<h3>My Baby's Favourite Food - Event</h3>
<p>We are hosting an event for all moms, out there. Anything particular your baby enjoyed eating? Please share it with us!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">Here are the guidelines for participating :</p>

<ol>
<li>Write a blog post giving us the recipe of a dish your child liked as a baby. Preferably, the post should have a picture of the dish.</li>
<li>Link your blog post back to this event announcement <a href="http://babyfoodrecipes.in/event">http://babyfoodrecipes.in/event</a>. </li>
<li>Submit your entry using the below form</li>
</ol>

<p>You can submit old blog posts too if you like. 3 lucky people will be gifted my e-book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Recipes-your-Baby-ebook/dp/B007QVHWDO">60 Great Baby Food Recipes</a>. This book is currently being sold on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Recipes-your-Baby-ebook/dp/B007QVHWDO">Amazon</a>. You can also send me a picture of the baby who liked this baby food recipe you are sending. I will include him in the hall of fame on this site :-)</p>
