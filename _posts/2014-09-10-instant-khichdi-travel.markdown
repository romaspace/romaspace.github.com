This mix is handy while travelling with a little baby. Once steamed, it has a
texture like that of idly. You can carry an electric cooker, plug it in your
hotel room and steam the Instant khichdi mix. That way you can quickly
have the baby's lunch ready in the comfort of your room.
Please try feeding your baby this dish once or twice before you leave on
your journey otherwise you might find it difficult in a new place if he
rejects it.

 <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
 <ul>
     <li>2 tablespoons of yellow moong dal</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons of rice</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon of ghee</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Procedure :</h2>
 <h3>To make the powdered mix :</h3>
 <ol>
	<li>Mix the dal and rice. Wash well till the milkiness goes away and dry it
	in the sun.</li>
	<li>Heat ghee and roast this mixture in it for about 5-7 minutes.</li>
	<li>The mixture will start turning light brown indicating it's done.</li>
	<li>Now cool it and grind it to desired consistency in a mixer jar.</li>
	<li>Store this in an air-tight container and pack it in your travel bag.</li>
 </ol>

<h3>To make the khichdi :</h3>
<p>
	When you need to feed the baby, boil a teaspoon of this mix in 1/4 cup
	water for about 5-7 minutes, stirring continuously. You can float the vessel
	containing khichdi mix over water that is boiling in an electric cooker. You
	can also boil water in a stainless steel vessel placed over an induction
	heater and cook the khichdi mix in a similar manner. These gadgets are
	useful in a hotel room where you might need to quickly cook something for
	the baby in a hygienic setting.
</p>

 <h2>Notes :</h2>
   <ol>
	<li>Add a tiny pinch of salt to the khichdi once the baby is older.</li>
	<li>This mix has a shelf life of about a week. If you don't roast the dal
	and rice in ghee the taste becomes a bit bland but you get a longer
	shelf life.</li>
   </ol>
