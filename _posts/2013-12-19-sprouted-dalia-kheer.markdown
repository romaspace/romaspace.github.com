Sprouted broken wheat appears as dry short granules of wheat. It's commonly available in organic food stores. 
It's a healthier option as compared to plain broken wheat (dalia in Hindi). You can also try to sprout wheat grains yourself. 
This takes about 2-3 days along with some effort in changing the water from time to time. However, freshly sprouted wheat is 
a far healthier option. Once wheat germinates, grind it and roast the paste in ghee till it's dry. Add boiled milk and 
follow the rest of the procedure in the same manner as given below. If you grind the wheat germs fine and don't thicken 
the milk too much it can also be had as a healthy drink, not only for babies but also for adults. 
Please remember that whatever quantity of wheat seeds you take it will swell to four times on germinating.

<h2>Nutritional Facts :</h2>

<ul>
<li>Broken wheat is an excellent source of fiber since it contains both bran and germ layers. </li>
<li>It's more nutritious to use sprouted broken wheat in which wheat grains have been germinated, dried and then 
broken into short granules. Sprouting boosts up the content of Vitamin E, Vitamin C and B-Vitamins in wheat grains. </li>
