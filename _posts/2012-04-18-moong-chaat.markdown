<h2>Green Moong Chaat</h2>


<p>Once moong dal is soaked and boiled, it serves as a great pick-n-eat dish for the baby. Gently mash each grain between your fingers and place it in front of the baby to eat on his own. If your baby (like mine) loves to put everything in the mouth this is definitely going to be a treat.

You just need to ensure that he doesn't stuff too many at once. If your baby isn't able to eat on his own, it's really ok. You can mash and feed him the grains as well. Its just that allowing him to eat himself is helpful in making him independent.</p>

<h3>Ingredients :</h3>

<ul>

<li>1/2 cup green moong dal</li>

<li>1/4 teaspoon oil</li>

<li>1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera)</li>

<li>A pinch of asafetida (hing), jaggery and black salt (kala namak)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Procedure :</h3>

<ol>

<li>Soak green moong dal over night.</li>

<li>Boil them in water for about 15 - 20 mins till soft (not completely mashed).</li>

<li>Heat oil. Crackle the cumin seeds and add a pinch of asafetida.</li>

<li>Now add the moong dal and cook over sim till the dal dries up.</li>

<li>Add black salt, jaggery and stir well.</li>

<li>Cover the pan and continue to cook for 5 more minutes on sim heat.</li>

<li>Now turn off the heat. Gently Mash moong dal with a spoon and serve it with curd (optional).</li>

</ol>

<h3>Please Note</h3>

<ul>

<li>This is a great breakfast for adults as well. You just need to use regular salt and avoid the jaggery in this recipe. You can also use onion in the tempering and enjoy this nutritious chaat with curd and sweet tamarind chutney.</li>

<li>Try not to discard the water that remains after boiling the moong dal in Step 2. Use it in making soup or kneading chappati dough so as to

not lose out on its nutrition.</li>
