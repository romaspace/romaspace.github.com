Apple sauce or Applesauce is a puree made of apples. It contains pectin which tends to make stools firm. 
Hence it’s effective in reducing loose motions. Apple once chopped starts turning brown in contact with air. 
To delay browning you can soak the pieces in some water (actually, lime water is more effective but we don’t 
want to make the apples sour for the baby).
