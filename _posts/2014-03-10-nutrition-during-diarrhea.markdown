<p>
Babies can have a bout of diarrhea due to any reason like a stomach infection, teething, eating excessive food that is laxative 
in nature (raisins, black salt, milk shakes, etc;) , reaction to antibiotics etc; 
</p>
<p>
Another common cause for diarrhea is heat. During summer months its common to have food, especially diary products, go bad easily. Hence as a precautionary method 
avoid feeding the baby any diary products (milk, curd, etc,) or uncooked food (chutneys, sprouts, salad, etc,) bought from outside.

If the baby suffers from diarrhea you can change his/her nutritional intake. Here are some dishes that are 
perfect for controlling a diarrhea :
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sabudana Porridge :</b> Soak 1 tablespoon Sabudana or Sago seeds till soft. Boil them in a cup of water till they turn translucent. 
Strain and feed the water to the baby.</li>
<li><b>Apple Sauce :</b> Apple contains pectin which tends to make stool firm. Hence, it is effective in reducing loose motions.
Please refer to the <a href="/apple-sauce">Apple Sauce </a> recipe.</li>
<li><b>Pomegranate juice :</b> strain pomegranate seeds and feed the juice to the baby.</li>
<li><b>Re-hydrating solutions</b> like buttermilk, rice porridge, arrowroot porridge are helpful in replenishing electrolytes 
lost in diarrhea. For rice and arrowroot porridge, you need to boil the rice or arrowroot powder in water, strain and 
feed the baby. Add a pinch of salt and sugar to it so it serves as a homemade ORS solution (check with doctor before 
feeding because salt and sugar are restricted ingredients and should be avoided till 10 months of age).</li>
<li><b>Curd</b> : Freshly set curd helps in relieving diarrhea as it contains lactobacillus, a good bacteria which aids digestion. 
It is not only a rich source of Calcium and Vitamin B 12 but also a promoter for gut integrity. 
It can prevent gassiness, provided it is not sour. This is why lactose-intolerant people are tolerant towards curd. 
Both Sabudana and Arrowroot porridge can be prepared in a thick consistency using water and finally mixed with freshly 
set curd before feeding the baby.</li>
</ul>

During diarrhea <b>please avoid</b> dairy products (other than curd), fruits, milk shakes and all kinds of dried currants like - raisins, prunes and sultanas.
