<h2>Ingredients :</h2>

<h3>Wash and Dry :</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup whole wheat grains </li>
<li>1 cup rice </li>
<li>1 cup fried gram (to create good consistency and flavour) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sprout and Dry :</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup whole grain ragi/ finger millet </li>
<li>1 cup green whole moong dal </li>
<li>1/2 cup soya beans </li>
</ul>


<h2>Procedure :</h2>

<h3>To make the powdered mix :</h3>
<ol>
<li>Soak soya beans, moong dal and ragi for 8 -10 hours. </li>
<li>Drain out the water and allow them to sprout in a strainer for another 8-10 hours. </li>
<li>Wash wheat and rice grains. </li>
<li>Dry wheat and rice grains along with moong dal, ragi and soya bean sprouts by patting them with a dry cloth. </li>
<li>Roast them in a hot wok till completely dry. Alternately, spread the grains on a baking tray and place it in a pre-heated oven at 175 Deg C. Ragi will take about 10 - 15 mins to dry (stir once in between). Moong dal and soya beans being larger grains will take about 30 - 35 mins to dry (stir every 10 mins). Ensure that you spread the grains evenly on the surface area of the baking tray without any overlap. </li>
<li>Once cool, grind all the grains along with fried gram into a powder. Fried Gram doesn't need to be washed and roasted. It can directly be ground along with the mix eventually. </li>
<li>Store this mix in an airtight container. </li>
</ol>

<h3>To make porridge :</h3>
<ol>
<li>To make porridge, mix 2 teaspoons of the Healthy Wholesome mix in 2 tablespoons of water and make a paste. </li>
<li>Pour this paste into a cup of hot water (or milk once baby is older). </li>
<li>Bring mixture to boil. Cool and feed the baby. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Nutritional Facts :</h2>
<ul>
<li>Whole Wheat grains contain a good level of dietary fiber and manganese. </li>
<li>Finger Millet is a rich source of calcium and protein. </li>
<li>Green moong and soya beans are both a good source of dietary fiber and proteins. </li>
<li>You can use <a href="/brown-rice">brown rice</a> instead of white rice to make this mix more nutritious.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes :</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid feeding this mix to a baby suffering from stomach ache or loose stools.</li>
<li>It's not recommended to add dry fruits to this mixture during preparation as they tend to release their natural oils and the mixture could have a reduced shelf life. However, you can add a previously prepared dry fruit mix to the porridge while serving. </li>
<li>You can add a pinch of jaggery to this porridge once the baby above 10 months old.</li>
</ul>
