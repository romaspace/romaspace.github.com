        Babies at this age can not be given anything sweet so this halwa (or mash) is a welcome change as it contains the natural sweetness of carrots and raisins. It can alternately be made by other sweet vegetables like beetroot, pumpkin or sweet potato.

        If your baby doesn't have a sweet tooth you can use bottle gourd instead.

        <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>1/2 cup grated carrot</li>

          <li>1 teaspoon ghee</li>

          <li>A pinch of cardamom seed powder</li>

          <li>2-3 raisins</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure :</h2>

        <ol>

          <li>Heat ghee. Fry raisins till they swell. Set them aside.</li>

          <li>In the remaining ghee fry the grated carrot till it turns translucent.</li>

          <li>Now add a pinch of cardamom seed powder, previously fried raisins and a tablespoon of water.</li>

          <li>Continue to cook till mixture comes together.</li>

          <li>Turn off the heat. Mash and serve the halwa warm.</li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Please Note :</h2>

        <div><ul>

            <li>You can make beetroot, pumpkin, sweet potato or bottle gourd halwa in the same method as above.</li>

            <li>You can also add dry fruit mix to this halwa before serving.</li>

            <li>Once the baby is over 10 months old you can add 1/2 teaspoon of jaggery and 1 tablespoon of thickened milk to this halwa for a better taste (thickened milk is not condensed milk. It's milk which is boiled and reduced to half. It does not contain any sugar).</li>

            <li>Please go easy on those raisins. They are rich in calcium and fiber hence having too many in a day could cause diarrhea.</li>

          </ul>

        </div>



        <h2>Nutritional Facts :</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>Carrots are rich in Beta-carotene which the body converts to Vitamin A. Orange carrots are more nutritious than red ones.</li>

        </ul>
