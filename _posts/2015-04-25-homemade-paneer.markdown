Although paneer or cottage cheese is readily available in the market today, it's advisable to make paneer at home for your baby. 
Paneer is a milk product that gets spoilt easily in heat. During summer months when it's being delivered to stores or when there 
are power cuts, the heat could ruin it. Spoilt paneer in turn causes stomach infection. Hence, fresh homemade paneer is the best 
and so is curd or any other milk product.

<h2>Ingredients :</h2>
<ul>
<li>1/2 litre milk </li>
<li>1 teaspoon fresh lime juice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure :</h2>

<ol>

<li>Boil milk. Add lime juice and reduce the heat. </li>

<li>Stir till the milk curdles. You know that it's done when the whey (liquid portion) looks completely transparent. </li>

<li>Strain the curdled milk through a muslin cloth. </li>
<li>Tie the cloth and hang it till the whey drains out completely. This will take a few hours. 
For faster results, squeeze out as much whey as possible before tying the cloth bag.</li>
<li>Once all the water is out, press the residue under a heavy object for 2 hours. </li>
<li>Once the paneer binds, refrigerate for an hour. </li>
<li>Take out the paneer slab and cut it into pieces. Use this paneer in making dishes for the baby.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Please Note :</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Do not use milk that's split on its own as the paneer won't bind well. It's always advisable to split milk using an agent.</li>
<li>Instead of lime juice you can use about 2 teaspoons of fresh curd to curdle 1/2 litre of milk. The curdling procedure is the same as above.</li>
<li>Paneer can be crumbled and garnished on cooked vegetables, whether dry or in a gravy.  It can also be grated into chapati dough to make soft, delicious parathas.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Nutritional Facts :</h2>

</ul>
