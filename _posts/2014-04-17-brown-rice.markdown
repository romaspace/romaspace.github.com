Rice is usually introduced to babies in the form of rice porridge at the age of 6 months. Rice is a 
perfect choice while introducing solids as it does not contain gluten. That eliminates the risk of gluten allergy. 
It is also an excellent source of carbohydrates.

While choosing rice for making baby food it is a great idea to select brown rice over the refined, white varieties. The reason behind this is 
that brown rice is only partially milled. The husk is removed whereas the bran and germ layers are intact making it rich in dietary fiber and manganese. 
It also contains selenium, magnesium, protein and a wide range of vitamins. 
The high fiber in Brown rice makes the stomach feel full in lesser quantity of rice. It also adds bulk to the stool aiding regular bowel cycles.

Rice porridge serves as a good re-hydrating solution for babies suffering from diarrhea. The porridge can be made by cooking the rice in 4 times 
the quantity of water and straining the solution out.  You can use brown rice as a replacement in all rice varieties you make for the baby like â€“ 
vegetable khichdi, curd rice, dal rice, etc. Just replace white rice with brown in any recipe you otherwise make. 
Add a little extra water while cooking. Keep in mind that brown rice being rich in fiber takes longer to cook. So either soak it for an hour before 
cooking or let it cook for more time. Please do not discard the water in which it is soaked, use it while cooking.

Eating brown rice has benefits for adults as well. Brown rice stabilizes the blood sugar level. The fiber in it reduces the glycemic index of the 
carbohydrates present. This results in slower conversion of carbohydrates into sugar allowing the blood sugar level to be regulated well. 
This is why brown rice is highly recommended for people suffering from diabetes. Also, people who are interested in a healthy 
lifestyle must include this grain as a part of their daily diet.
