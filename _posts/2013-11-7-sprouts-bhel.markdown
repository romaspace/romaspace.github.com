The vitamins, minerals and protein content of green moong dal can be substantially increased by sprouting.

Although sprouts are best eaten raw, here we blanch the sprouts for a few minutes in boiling water so it's easy for the baby to swallow. When mixed with finely chopped salad, it serves as a nutritious and filling breakfast.
