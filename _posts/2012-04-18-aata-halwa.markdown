<div class="blog-content">
<h3>Ingredients :</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 teaspoons of ghee</li>
<li>4 teaspoons of wheat flour (aata)</li>
<li>A pinch of cardamom powder</li>
<li>1 cup milk</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon jaggery</li>
<li>Few raisins</li>
<li>Fruits of your choice (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Procedure :</h3>
<ol>
<li>Heat ghee in a heavy-bottomed pot.</li>
<li>Add raisins and set aside once they swell.</li>
<li>To the remaining ghee in the pot add wheat flour and roast well till you get the smell of cooked flour.  </li>
<li>Mix in cardamom powder and stir well.</li>
<li>Separately, boil milk with jaggery till it dissolves completely.  </li>
<li>Add the sweetened milk into the roasted wheat flour. Stir continuously, till the mixture becomes pasty and has no lumps.</li>
<li>Mix in the previously fried raisins and turn off the heat.</li>
<li>Once cool, you can add mashed banana (small variety)/ sapota/ steamed apple to the halwa.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Please Note</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You can use fine semolina (chiroti rawa) instead of wheat flour in this halwa.</li>
<li>You can also add a teaspoon of <a href='#recipe_16'>dry fruit mix</a> to the halwa once it's ready. </li>
</ul>
