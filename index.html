                <p>This book is an encapsulation of my journey as a mother and my learnings in the process introducing solids to my babies. It contains 60 handpicked, vegetarian recipes that have been reviewed by experts like a pediatrician and nutritionist to ensure accuracy in the information provided. The focus is on babies between the age of 6 - 24 months. The recipes have been categorized based on the baby's age. </p>

              <div class="span6">
                <p>In the first one year of a baby's development there are several restricted ingredients. Food made for them changes every few months. Along with that comes the added responsibility of feeding them healthy food. Since babies can't express themselves, their likes and dislikes have always been a mystery. 
The main aim of this book is to simplify this phase by creating food that is not only nutritious but also liked by the baby. Besides recipes the book contains information on travel food, medicinal food, tips to tackle fussy eaters and more....  </p>

I am myself a cooking enthusiast and have believed that cooking at home inculcates healthy eating habits in growing children. Roma Sharma has made a wonderful contribution through this unique book by offering variety to fussy eaters and helping desperate mothers. Her own experience as the mother of two young children is reflected in this effort. The meals are also nutritionally well balanced.”

There was no neat book that told us what to feed when the kid starts teething, or when the kid has grown to be a toddler. It told us what to feed when the baby is cranky or acts fussy with food. This book helped us get exactly what we looking for.”

              <p> Roma is a software engineer by education and a chef by passion. After working for 6 years in the IT industry she turned a home maker. With two kids now she spends most of her time creating new dishes to excite them with. Besides cooking, she has hobbies like photography and blogging. She loves experimenting with different types of cuisines.</p>

              <p>When Roma first had a baby she realized that baby food is a confusing subject. The type of food that can be fed to a baby at each stage of growth is something that needs to be checked every time something new is introduced. Her baby’s pediatrician was helpful in this regard. She would clarify doubts on ingredients permitted for the baby at each stage. She also had the good fortune of talking to her grandmother about the dishes she use to feed her kids. Her mother shared knowledge she had on medicinal and travel food.</p>
