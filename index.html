This book is an encapsulation of my journey as a mother and my learning in the process introducing solids to my babies. It contains 60 handpicked, vegetarian recipes that have been reviewed by experts like pediatricians and nutritionists to ensure accuracy in the information provided. The focus is on babies between the age of 6-24 months. The recipes have been categorized based on the baby's age.

In the first one year of a baby's development there are several restricted ingredients. Food made for them changes every few months. Along with that comes the added responsibility of feeding them healthy food. Since babies can't express themselves, their likes and dislikes have always been a mystery. 
</p>
<p>
The main aim of this book is to simplify this phase by creating food that is not only nutritious but also liked by the baby. Besides recipes this book contains information on travel food, medicinal food, tips to tackle fussy eaters and more....

 In October 2013, we self-published a paperback edition of the book.

 him/ her for the first time.
