          In the first one year we find babies frequently facing problems like stomach ache due to gas, diarrhea, nappy rash, constipation, cold, etc; Instead of immediately seeking medical attention its advisable to try out some simple remedies at home. In fact, that is exactly what our grandmothers use to do during those days when doctors where not easily available. This book provides some of those home remedies that could help you relieve your baby of minor ailments at home. (This information however does not replace medical advice. Please consult a doctor for persistent issues.)
          </p>
          <p>
          With all the recipes provided to tickle the taste buds of your little one its important to remember that we suggest you continue to breast feed your baby up to the age of 2 years. The dishes suggested are not intended to replace breast milk which is the best food for your baby. The book contains details on the benefits of breast feeding. Please read through it before deciding when to wean your baby off breast milk.

          <p>
          I am a software engineer by education and a chef by passion. After an experience of 6 years in the IT industry I turned a home maker. With two kids now I spend most of my time  creating new dishes to excite them with. Besides cooking, I have hobbies like photography and <a href="http://romasharma.com">blogging</a>. I love experimenting with different types of cuisines and seldom leave a restaurant without trying to learn something new out of what I have eaten.
          </p>
          <p>
          When I had a baby I realized that baby food is a really confusing subject. The type of food that can be fed to a baby at each stage of growth is something that we need to check on every time we introduce something new. My baby’s pediatrician was helpful in this regard. She would clarify my doubts on ingredients permitted for my baby at each stage. I also had the good fortune of talking to my grandmother about the dishes she use to feed her kids. My mother shared knowledge she had on medicinal and travel food. I started <a href="http://romasharma.com">blogging</a> these recipes when my first baby was 8 months old. Along with blogging, I started writing this book when I introduced solids to my first baby 4 years ago. Now with another 18-month old I have updated more recipes and have compiled all the information I have to make a book that is easy to consume.
          </p>

		   I hope you enjoy reading this book and above that I hope your baby likes the dishes provided. I would love to hear from you : roma(at)romasharma(dot)com
